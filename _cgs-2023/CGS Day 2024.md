<p>On 19 October 2024, the Upper Boon Keng community came together for a
remarkable display of civic responsibility and environmental stewardship
at the Community Clean Up @ Upper Boon Keng. Held at the Upper Boon Keng
Market &amp; Food Centre, the event saw 50 dedicated volunteers from diverse
backgrounds united in their commitment to a Clean &amp; Green Singapore.</p>
<p>Senior Minister of State for the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment,
Dr. Koh Poh Koon, and Minister for the Ministry of Digital Development
and Information, Josephine Teo, who also serves as the Adviser to Kolam
Ayer Grassroots Organisations (GROs), led by example by joining enthusiastic
volunteers in their efforts to keep the neighbourhood clean.</p>
<p>The event brought together a cross-section of society, including SG Clean
Ambassadors, Kolam Ayer GROs, migrant workers from MOM-ACE, and representatives
from the Federation of Merchants' Associations Singapore (FMAS) and Kao
Singapore. Their collective efforts not only improved the area's cleanliness
but also served as a visible reminder of the importance of maintaining
public spaces.</p>
<p>A highlight of the event was the distribution of Magiclean disinfectants,
generously sponsored by Kao Singapore, to the hawkers at Upper Boon Keng
Market &amp; Food Centre. This initiative emphasised the significance of
good hygiene practices in the food and beverage industry.</p>
<p>The Community Clean Up @ Upper Boon Keng exemplifies the Singapore spirit,
showcasing what can be achieved when communities unite for a common purpose:
to create a Clean &amp; Green Singapore for everyone.</p>
