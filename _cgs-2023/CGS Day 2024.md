<p>Eco Paddle with Ola' was held on 13 October 2024, at Siloso Beach in Sentosa,
co-organised by Ola Beach Club and the National Environment Agency (NEA).
The event is part of a series of clean-up activities across Singapore this
year, at residential estates, beaches, parks, reservoirs and waterways,
in support of 2024 as the Year of Public Hygiene.
<br>
<br>Senior Parliamentary Secretary for the Ministry of Sustainability and
the Environment, Mr. Baey Yam Keng, joined more than 100 volunteers from
the community, Coca-Cola Singapore, Public Hygiene Council, NEA Volunteer
Corps, Singapore Paddle Club, Sentosa Development Corp (SDC) and Friends
of ACE (a migrant worker volunteer network under the Ministry of Manpower)
to clean up the shoreline, both from kayaks as well as on land. Soffell
Singapore also supported the event by sponsoring insect repellents for
all participants. The event was also supported by sponsors, such as Mount
Faber Leisure Group, Soffell Singapore, and SDC.
<br>
<br>In addition to a meaningful Sunday morning on the island, Mr Baey visited
the "Rallying Island Sustainability Efforts" RISE exhibition at Sentosa's
Beach Station, where SDC representatives showcased various sustainability
initiatives such as solarisation, recycling, electric vehicle adoption,
farm-to-table practices, waste management and marine habitat conservation.
Mr Baey also participated in the miniTrashlab workshop hosted by Mount
Faber Leisure Group. During this session, participants exercised their
creativity by repurposing materials from retired kayaks, Skyline Luge carts,
and other plastic waste to create decorative bowls, which they could then
take home.
<br>
<br>The event highlights the important role volunteers play in contributing
to a clean environment, as well as supporting marine conservation efforts.</p>

<p>International E-Waste Day (IEWD) is organised annually, to raise public
awareness on e-waste recycling and to encourage members of public to recycle
their e-waste. The theme for IEWD 2024 was “Secure E-Waste Recycling: Let’s
Make a Difference Together”, and focused on data security. The event was
co-organised by the National Environment Agency and ALBA E-Waste Smart
Recycling, the appointed operator of the Producer Responsibility Scheme
for E-Waste.
<br>
<br>Launched by Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment,
Dr Amy Khor, on 13 October 2024 at Westgate Mall, IEWD 2024 helped raise
public awareness of the secure recycling of data-bearing devices such as
mobile phones and laptops. Participants learned more about e-waste management,
especially the data sanitisation and dismantling processes that the e-waste
recyclers undertake, by visiting the many educational booths and activities
by ALBA E-Waste Smart Recycling and other industry and community stakeholders.
<br>
<br>IEWD 2024 also served as a platform to recognise and celebrate the efforts
and support from various stakeholders who have contributed to e-waste management,
and underscored the overall importance of recycling, including e-waste,
in Singapore, as we move towards becoming a zero-waste nation.</p>

<p>On 19 October 2024, Senior Minister of State for the Ministry of Sustainability
and the Environment, Dr. Koh Poh Koon joined over 50 volunteers for the
Community Clean Up @ Upper Boon Keng event. The event brought together
a diverse group comprising SG Clean Ambassadors, Kolam Ayer Grassroots
Organisations, migrant workers volunteers, and representatives from the
Federation of Merchants' Associations Singapore and Kao Singapore. SMS
Koh was joined by Minister for the Ministry of Digital Development and
Information, Ms Josephine Teo, who serves as the Adviser to Kolam Ayer
Grassroots Organisations (GROs).
<br>
<br>The group of volunteers fanned out across the Upper Boon Keng neighbourhood,
picking up all the litter they could find. Their collective efforts not
only improved the area's cleanliness but also demonstrated how stakeholders
from a wide variety of different communities can come together, for the
common cause of keeping shared public spaces clean.
<br>
<br>In addition to joining the litter-picking activities, SMS Koh and Minister
Josephine distributed Magiclean disinfectants and kitchen cleaners, sponsored
by Kao Singapore, to the hawkers at Upper Boon Keng Market &amp; Food Centre.
This initiative was a gesture of appreciation to the hawkers, for their
important role in providing safe, delicious food for everyone, through
good hygiene practices, and also supports 2024 as the Year of Public Hygiene.
<br>
<br>The Community Clean Up @ Upper Boon Keng helped shine a spotlight on the
community spirit of taking greater ownership of the environment, in action.
Ground-up community activities such as this are the core driver of the
Clean &amp; Green Singapore movement.</p>

<p>On 23 October 2024, Gardens by the Bay hosted its annual flagship educational
programme, Race to Sustainability! This year, for the first time, the event
was expanded from upper primary and secondary students, to include lower
primary and tertiary students as well. This year’s theme centres on exploring
sustainability through imagination and creative play and also supports
the Year of Public Hygiene.
<br>
<br>Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, Ms Grace Fu, flagged
off the Race, which involved nearly 5,000 students over two days, from
20 schools. Participants engaged in a variety of interactive activities
designed to deepen their understanding of climate change and environmental
stewardship. Students explored the Gardens, solving puzzles at various
stations designed to inspire them to adopt eco-friendly habits in their
daily lives, and learning about Singapore's efforts to balance development
with environmental conservation.
<br>
<br>In addition to multiple game stations with environmentally-themed challenges,
highlights of Race to Sustainability! included a “Sustainable Singapore:
Today and Tomorrow” interactive wall, showcasing Singapore’s sustainable
development efforts, a “Make a Wish for a Greener Future” trellis, where
participants penned and tied their wishes for a greener future using upcycled
fabric strips, and a artworks display titled “Unhappily Ever After”, by
American animation storyboard artist, Jeff Hong, featuring iconic animated
characters that puts the spotlight on human activities and our impact on
the planet. These sustainability-focused exhibitions are available to the
public until 1 December 2024.
<br>
<br>This annual collaborative effort, involving Gardens by the Bay, NEA and
various partners, is committed to nurturing the environmental stewards
of tomorrow. By fostering a strong sense of environmental awareness and
ownership in the younger generation, we can help build a Clean and Green
Singapore for generations to come!</p>
