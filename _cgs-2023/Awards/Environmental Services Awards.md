<h3><strong>Environmental Services Awards</strong></h3>
<p>The Environmental Services (ES) Awards was first introduced at the Environmental
Services Workforce Day in 2019, as a key initiative of the Environmental
Services Industry Transformation Map (ES ITM) to celebrate the commitment
and excellence of ES companies and employees. Supported by the Environmental
Management Association of Singapore (EMAS), Waste Management &amp; Recycling
Association of Singapore (WMRAS), Singapore Pest Management Association
(SPMA), and National Trades Union Congress (NTUC), the ES Awards comprises
of two awards â€“ the ES Star Award and the ES Achievement Award (previously
known as Certificate of Excellence).</p>
<p>The ES Star Award recognises the commitment, work excellence, and contributions
of exemplary ES employees across the ES industry (comprising cleaning services,
waste management, and pest management sectors) in three categories (frontline,
supervisory, and operations support). In 2024, 27 individuals received
the ES Star Award and were exemplary for demonstrating exceptional service
excellence, good teamwork and leadership, a proactive attitude to upskilling
themselves, and outstanding contributions to innovation, productivity and
environmental sustainability, in their profession.</p>
<p>The ES Achievement Award recognises ES employees for their contributions,
commitment and exemplary work performance. Recipients include those who
had demonstrated service excellence, had been promoted or recognised for
long service by their employers, and possess a positive mindset and willingness
to upskill. In 2024, 390 ES employees received the ES Achievement Award.</p>
<p>Congratulations to all ES Awards recipients!</p>
