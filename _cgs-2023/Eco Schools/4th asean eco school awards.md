<h3><strong>4th ASEAN Eco-schools Award</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Northoaks Primary School&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>Northoaks Primary School develops future-ready learners and leaders who
are advocates and champions for environmental sustainability by providing
students with the opportunities to acquire knowledge, values, attitudes,
commitment and skills needed to protect and improve the environment.
<br>
<br>The school initiated the ECO-Brick project to increase awareness on the
importance of plastic usage reduction. Students collected plastic bottles
and converted it into a 'solid' brick-like material, which were then upcycled
into stools placed around the school.</p>

</p>
<p>The school also integrates environmental knowledge in their Applied Learning
Programme (ALP) and Programme for Active Learning (PAL), where students
engage in innovative projects such as designing toys from recyclables.
Environmental education is also incorporated into their Values-in-Action
(ViA) programme from Primary 1 to Primary 6. For example, Primary 4 students
developed solutions to reduce food waste as well as energy conservation.</p>

<p>Besides focusing on the 3Rs, donation drives are conducted all year round,
with textiles and used books donated to underprivileged families. Initiatives
such as Bring Your Own container campaign and Meat-free day were also organised
in Northoaks Primary to raise awareness amongst students on reducing their
carbon footprint. The school also actively engage the community on environmental
practicessuch as ontray return and sharing of green projects at various
community events.</p>

<p>The school’s Environment Science Club also plays an important role in
championing the school’s efforts in conserving the environment. Some of
their key environmental activities include waste recycling, water and energy
conservation, biodiversity cultivation, upcycling promotion, and environmental
education advocacy. Termly assembly talks, energy and water conservation
campaigns are organised by the club to raise awareness among students across
different levels about the impact of human actions on the environment.
With a focus on upcycling and environmental sustainability, the club members
also engage the school community with hands-on workshops, e.g. creating
upcycled bracelets using toilet rolls and leaves, DIY wallets and coasters
using recycled paper. Besides involving students, staff and parents also
participated in some of these workshops.</p>

<p><strong>Compassvale Secondary School</strong>
</p>
<p>Compassvale Secondary School has a holistic and whole-school approach
to environmental sustainability. The school’s commitment to advocate and
engage in sustainable living is demonstrated through the school’s environment
education programme which is embedded in the school’s curriculum and co-curriculum.
<br>
<br>In the curriculum, the school’s Interdisciplinary Project Work (IPW) for
all lower secondary students is anchored on the theme of Sustainable Living,
to educate students about environmental challenges, as well as their impact,
and how they can make a difference as active and concerned citizens of
the world.</p>

<p><em>Students sharing the importance of recycling e-waste right as part of the Lower Secondary Interdisciplinary Project Work curriculum</em>
</p>
<p>In IPW, the Secondary 1 curriculum focuses on waste management while the
Secondary 2 curriculum focuses on energy sustainability. The school adopts
Design Thinking which forms the basis of the curriculum design, where it
is a non-linear, iterative process that students use to understand users,
challenge assumptions, redefine problems and create innovative solutions
to prototype and test. Going forward, the school will integrate this into
the school’s signature Applied Learning Programme and Design &amp; Technology
curriculum, for greater pervasiveness of environmental awareness in the
school’s curriculum.
<br>
<br>Another area in which the school infuses environment education is through
the Learning for Life Programme, which aims to develop students in community
&amp; youth leadership and inspire them to create positive impact in the
community through active community service and environmental outreach.
Through carefully curated Values-in-Action experiences such as the Green
Compass Programme, lower secondary students are empowered to learn and
enact &nbsp;environmental sustainability via attending assembly talks on
waste management, participating in upcycling workshops and carry out advocacy
campaigns targeting their peers, family and the community and embarking
on recyclables collection drives.</p>

</p>
<p>In the co-curriculum, the Environment Club spearheads the sustainability
efforts at student-level. The CCA is a thriving community passionate about
championing different environmental causes. It also leads efforts in commemorating
World Environmental Events to raise awareness of existential environmental
challenges and the role each member of the community plays. Two Environment
Champions within the class committee structure of each class lead their
peers in adopting sustainable practices. They also promote responsible
waste management, share about pertinent environmental issues, and maintain
the recycling bins in the classroom. Going forward, the school is infusing
science-informed research into the Environment Club programmes to strengthen
outcomes.&nbsp;</p>
