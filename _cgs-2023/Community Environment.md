<h3><strong>NORTH EAST DISTRICT</strong></h3>
<p><strong>North East Green Adventure</strong>
</p>
<p>The North East Green Adventure programme aims to promote environmental
awareness among children aged 4 to 9 years old. The programme features
five green superheroes, each championing a pillar of good eco-habits (1)
Saving Our Energy, (2) Recycling Right, (3) Reducing Food Wastage, (4)
Keeping Our Environment Clean and (5) Ensuring Good Public Health. Children
can adopt these pillars to help save the environment.</p>
<p>Through workshops which comprises of engaging skits, sing-a-long music,
hands-on activities and fun quizzes, children are brought on an adventure
to learn about these eco-habits, gaining knowledge on environmental sustainability
and ownership.</p>
<p>Activity books and playing cards were also given to the children for them
to bring home and complete green activities with their family members.
These bonding sessions help to reinforce environmental awareness within
households to inspire them to care for and adopt a clean, green and sustainable
lifestyle. Since 2018, 320 workshops were conducted with participation
from close to 7,500 children.</p>

<h3><strong>SOUTH WEST DISTRICT</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Young Technopreneur Challenge 2023</strong>
</p>
<p>Organised by the South West CDC, HP Inc, and Junior Achievement (JA) Singapore,
the Young Technopreneur Challenge seeks to encourage students in developing
sustainable solutions in relation to United Nations Sustainable Development
Goals, Singapore Green Plan 2030 and Sustainable South West Masterplan.</p>
<p>A total of 24 teams with close to 100 students from 10 schools took part
in the challenge. Before pitching their ideas, students attended bootcamps
on Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), design thinking,
and pitch and presentation, as well as online self-paced courses via HP’s
free skills-training programme for entrepreneurs, business owners and lifelong
learners. HP employees also mentored the students who underwent a rigorous
design thinking and ideation process, while doing research and creating
their prototype.</p>
<p>The top three winning teams were given job shadowing opportunities at
HP Inc to gain real-life working experience. In addition, the champion
team received a funding of $3,000 for the implementation of their idea.</p>

<h3><strong>SOUTH EAST DISTRICT</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Wormery Movement</strong>
</p>
<p>In 2022, the amount of food waste generated in Singapore was 813,000 tonnes
with a recycling rate of 18%. Going forward, food waste generated is expected
to continue to rise. In response, South East CDC is introducing wormeries
as an alternative to food waste treatment and address food waste concerns
through an organic approach. Worms can consume and convert compostable
food waste into nitrogen-heavy natural fertiliser, to be used in gardens
for both recreational and agricultural purposes. This provides a platform
for our community to contribute their efforts towards our national agenda,
empower green citizenry, and adopt a circular economy lifestyle change.</p>
