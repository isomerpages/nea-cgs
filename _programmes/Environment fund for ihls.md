<h3>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQS)</h3>

</p>
<p>Applicants are to share all activities planned for the duration of the
project</p>
<p><strong>2. What can be counted as a YED activity?</strong>
</p>
<p>A YED activity must be aligned with the year’s YED topic. Please click

<p><strong>3. Can a project be considered for the Call for Ideas Fund (CIF) /3P Partnership Fund (PF) if it has been included in the workplan for the EFIHL submission?</strong>
</p>
<p>NEA does not support double funding of projects. While applicants may
include their workplan projects in the EFIHL application, they should clearly
state which project(s) would be seeking CIF/PF. Consequently, applicant
should not seek funding support for those project(s) from more than one
fund (EFIHL, CIF, PF).</p>
<p><strong>4. I am a new applicant for the EFIHL. What are the things that I need to take note of?</strong>
</p>
<p>We encourage all new applicants to read through the grant criteria and
to speak to the respective staff advisor(s), and get his/her endorsement
to apply for the EFIHL.</p>
<p>Upon approval, funds would be transferred to the environment group via
the staff advisor’s office account. Environment groups are encouraged to
check with the staff advisors from the IHL on the procedure in which the
funds would be received.</p>
<p><strong>5. How do I start a student environmental group in my IHL?</strong>
</p>
<p>You may wish to speak to a staff member in yout IHL (eg. student affairs/student
life/faculty offices/research centres) who may advise you on the environmental
issues that you may want to focus on and how to start and sustain an environmental
group in your IHL. NEA encourages more youths to take part in environmental
activities, and the grant will be extended to groups that fit the criteria.</p>
<p><strong>6. I am a staff adviser. What are the things I need to take note of when applying for the EFIHL?</strong>
</p>
<p>All interested staff advisers should read through the EFIHL criteria,
and evaluate if the clubs are able to fulfil them. In addition, the staff
adviser must assess the sustainability of the environment group, and if
the group has the capacity to improve on their projects with additional
funds.</p>
<p>The disbursement of grant will be done through the staff adviser, and
the staff adviser should ensure that the necessary financial arrangements
can be made. First time applicants will be required to submit a Direct
Credit Authorisation form for NEA to provide bank details for the fund
transfer.</p>
