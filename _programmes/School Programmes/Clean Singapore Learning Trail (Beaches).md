<p>Taking part in a beach clean-up is one way to keep the beaches and the
environment healthy for everyone to enjoy. To promote Values In Action
for students to care for the beaches, NEA revamped the Seashore Life Programme
to the Clean Singapore Learning Trail (Beaches) to encourage students to</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>understand the importance of taking ownership of our beaches,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reflect on how their own habits and actions affect Singaporeâ€™s cleanliness&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>inspire participants to take responsibility by cleaning the beach for
all to enjoy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Many have helped to clean the beaches for your families and friends to
enjoy. You can be part of the Values In Action programme and support the

<p>We are transitioning to a new one-stop e-Portal system to serve you better.
Online registration for the Clean Singapore Learning Trail (Beaches) will
resume in late August when the e-Portal system becomes operational.</p>
<p>In the meantime, new sign-ups for Clean Singapore Learning Trail (Beaches) <strong>will be closed</strong>.</p>
