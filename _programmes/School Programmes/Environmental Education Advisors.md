<h4>NEWLY APPOINTED AS THE TEACHER-IN-CHARGE FOR YOUR SCHOOL’S ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMMES? FRET NOT, NEA IS HERE TO GUIDE YOU AND BUILD YOUR EXPERTISE IN LEADING ENVIRONMENTAL OUTREACH PROJECTS IN YOUR SCHOOL.</h4>
<h4>Join NEA’s network of Environmental Education Advisors (EEAs)</h4>
<p>NEA has built a network of <strong>E</strong>nvironmental <strong>E</strong>ducation <strong>A</strong>dvisors
(EEAs) as a robust network of teachers who plan, coordinate and implement
environment programmes for their school students and staff as well as serve
as the contact point between NEA and the schools.</p>
<p>EEAs serve as a bridge to educate the young on environmental messages
and issues. EEAs are assisted in the development of environment programmes
for their schools by student Environment Champions. EEAs also provide feedback
to NEA on the programmes that NEA organises for schools and students.</p>
<p>Outstanding EEAs who have contributed to the environment are eligible
for NEA’s EcoFriend Award.</p>
<h4>EEA Workshops</h4>
<p>NEA organises two capacity-building workshops annually for EEAs. The one-day
EEA Workshop aims to equip EEAs with Motivational Design and Environmental
Project Management Skills so that they can help identify, spearhead and
initiate environmental programmes in their schools and explore possible
environmental concerns within the neighborhood and develop solutions to
the issues.</p>
<p>After the workshop, EEAs should be able to</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Learn how to lead the environmental activities and events in school</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ability to identify and implement values-based environmental programmes
within their school and community</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be part of the network to share and communicate their environmental activities
and ideas</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understand their roles and responsibilities as the environmental representatives
for their school, and the benefits to their school</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>EEAs are also aided with the <a href="/resources" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Environment Fund for Schools (EFS)</a> to help fund their
environmental programmes in schools.</p>
