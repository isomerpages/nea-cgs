<p>Together with The Singapore Scout Association and Girl Guides Singapore,
NEA has developed a refreshed badge programme for Cub Scouts and Brownies
between the ages of 9 to 12.</p>
<p>The programme equips Cub Scouts and Brownies with knowledge to enhance
their understanding of key environmental issues and take ownership of the
environment. Each Cub Scout or Brownie will undergo different training
programmes to earn badges under two tracks- the Keep Singapore Clean Badge
and Resource Conservation Badge tracks. Topics covered include mosquito
breeding and dengue prevention, tray return, cleanliness, 3Rs and waste
management, and energy efficiency and conservation.</p>
