<h3>Are you looking for ways to engage your students to keep the school and environment clean? NEA and the Public Hygiene Council have a variety of cleanliness-related programmes to assist you!</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>The Keep Singapore Clean Movement (KSCM) in Schools is a student-driven
and school-supported effort for students to take ownership of the cleanliness
of their school and the environment. It was launched by the Ministry of
Education (MOE) in July 2014 and supported by the Public Hygiene Council
(PHC).</p>
<p>In line with the KSCM in Schools, NEA launched a capacity building workshop
titled ‘Buddy Clean Workshop’ to assist schools to educate students on
the importance of keeping their school clean as well as to train them in
the various skills (e.g. teamwork, communication) required for the cleaning
activities. It is an environment-based Values-In-Action (VIA) programme
targeting at the Primary 3 and 4 students, which schools can take up to
fulfil the Character &amp; Citizenship curriculum.</p>
<h4>Buddy Clean Workshop</h4>
<p>The Buddy Clean Workshop is based on NEA’s programme – Project Buddy Clean,
which aims to inculcate positive social values and norms on cleanliness
amongst students. The project leveraged peer influence and feedback to
shape the behaviour of students. It also helps to foster shared ownership
and responsibility of common spaces through regular cohort-wide cleaning.
