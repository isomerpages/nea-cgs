<h4>Captain Green Storybooks and Teachers’ Resource Pack</h4>
<p>The Captain Green Environmental Storybook is a practical resource to support
pre-schooler’s learning about the environment through fun-loving storylines
created by the students from Ngee Ann Polytechnic’s School of Humanities
and Social Sciences. It aims to teach the children to take responsibility
for their actions and to reflect on their choices toward a clean and green
environment.</p>
<p>The Captain Green Teacher’s Resource Pack will aid the pre-school teachers
with knowledge on environmental health and hygiene issues that can be applied
in their pre-school teaching curriculum. The Captain Green Environmental
Storybook and Captain Green Teacher Resource Pack was distributed to all
pre-schools in April 2016.</p>
<p>The new materials are aligned with the refreshed kindergarten framework
and incorporate the refreshed Captain Green mascot.</p>
<p>The storybooks can be downloaded at&nbsp;<a href="/resources" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">www.cgs.gov.sg/resources</a>.</p>
<h4>Environmental Resource Book for Pre-schoolers and Parents</h4>
<p>To deepen the engagement of parents as a key partner and to assist them,
a resource book ‘A Quest to Save the Edmoral Kingdom’ was jointly developed
by final-year students from the Ngee Ann Polytechnic’s School of Humanities
&amp; Social Sciences and the National Environment Agency, with the aim
to help nurture good environmental practices and values in children.</p>
<p>Some of the components in the book include storytelling that reinforce
good environmental habits in children, simple learning activities and games
that parents can carry out with their children, and a guide for parents
to help their children to reflect on their choices toward their own environment.</p>
<p>The book was distributed to all K1 children in Singapore in September
2014. Currently, an e-version of ‘A Quest to Save the Edmoral Kingdom’
can be downloaded at <a href="/resources" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">www.cgs.gov.sg/resources</a>.</p>
