<h3><strong>Project E.C.O. (Educate. Challenge. Organise.)<br>Environment Protection Category – Primary School</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Radin Mas Primary School – Gold Award</strong>
</p>
<p>The project team members launched several recycling drives in their school,
collecting a variety of recyclables such as paper and plastic bottles.
These items were then repurposed for the school’s events, e.g. Maker’s
corner, Design week, and Mid-Autumn celebration.</p>

<p>The project team also initiated an upcycling project where they transformed
the bottles collected into planters to grow onions. A booth was set up
during the school’s Mid-Autumn celebration to engage their peers with hands-on
experiences in creating bottle planters and encouraged them to make their
own at home.</p>

<p>The team extended their outreach by partnering with Radin Mas Community
Centre to set up a booth during the Grassroots Organisations’ Mid-Autumn
celebration. The initiative was well received by residents, and more than
100 plastic bottles were transformed into bottle planters within an hour.
Many positive responses were received and residents were keen to replicate
the activity at home.</p>

<p><strong>Chongzheng Primary School – Silver Award</strong>
</p>
<p>The project team embarked on a 2-month project to address food waste in
their school. The team first conducted a survey on the Student Learning
Space (SLS) to gain insights of their peers' eating habits and the food
waste situation in school. The members then organised roadshows during
recess to achieve broader visibility and impact.</p>

<p><em>Stop Food Waste campaign in school</em>
</p>
<p>Understanding that food waste is one of the larger waste streams in Singapore,
the team members extended their outreach to the Student Care Centre in
Tampines to engage primary school students in the neighbourhood. They further
reinforced the 'Hi-Five' pledge which was created to reduce food waste
and shared it on the school's Facebook page. As a continuous effort to
raise awareness, the team engaged their schoolmates to conduct the ‘Hi-Five’
pledge during the end-of-year school holiday at home with their family
members and neighbours through SLS and school’s Facebook page.</p>

<p><strong>Mee Toh School – Bronze Award</strong>
</p>
<p>Weekly segregated recycling is an integral part of Mee Toh School’s environmental
sustainability efforts. Students brought recyclables from home every Wednesday
and sorted them. The project team aimed to further enculturate these practices
within the school by raising awareness of recycling right. They focused
on items commonly found in the school canteen, e.g. plastic bottles, tetra
paks, and aluminum cans, and created a PowerPoint presentation and a 2D
animation (FlipaClip) to educate their peers on how to recycle right. The
instructional videos were broadcasted to the student population during
assembly.</p>

</p>
<p>The project team also took up the responsibility of reinforcing proper
recycling practices among peers during their recess. The Mee Toh School
Green Day featured an assembly session on recycling right and the launch
of a recycling project at the school canteen.&nbsp; All these efforts resulted
in good recycling right habits in students and lesser contamination of
recyclables collected.</p>
