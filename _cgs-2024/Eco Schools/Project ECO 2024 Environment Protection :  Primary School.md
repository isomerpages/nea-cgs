<h3><strong>Project E.C.O 2024 - Environment Protection – Primary School</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Unity Primary School – Gold</strong>
</p>
<p>The project team embarked on a six-month initiative to promote sustainability
and waste reduction through recycling and upcycling. They organised booths
at the school’s annual Science and Green Carnival, inviting parent volunteers
to join the event. The carnival coincided with the launch of NEA’s Recycle
Right Campaign 2024, hosted by the school and graced by SPS (MSE), Mr Baey
Yam Keng.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The team collaborated with partnering kindergartens to conduct door-to-door
visits to collect recyclables and educate residents on proper recycling
practices. They also engaged three neighbouring PCF kindergartens, teaching
preschoolers about upcycling through crafts games such as the upcycled
Claw-It-Up game.</p>

<p>The students initiated a six-month project to address improper recycling
practices based on their observations of misuse of recycling bins in the
neighbourhood. The project aimed to raise awareness on correct recycling
methods and foster sustainable habits within the school community and homes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In conjunction with Earth Day, the team organised a week-long Green Week
campaign<s>,</s> to educate students on proper recycling habits. Recess
activities were conducted to teach students about correct recycling techniques<s>,</s> and
repurposing materials.</p>

titled "Pearl's Recycling Adventures”, which guided readers through Punggol's
eco-friendly landmarks and explores different recycling methods. The book
was presented to MK@Punggol Green Primary School and audiences at NLB@One
Punggol, with accompanying activities.</p>
