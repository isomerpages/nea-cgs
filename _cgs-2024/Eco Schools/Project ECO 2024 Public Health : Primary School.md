<h3><strong>Project E.C.O 2024 – Public Health - Primary</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Naval Base Primary School – Gold</strong>
</p>
<p>With their school’s Environment Motto “As Stewards of the Earth at NBPS,
we Nurture Biodiversity, Protect and Serve the Environment.” in mind, the
team embarked on an eight-month project to identify the causes of mosquito
breeding and found novel solutions to address them. The team designed e-posters,
carried out recess activities in collaboration with Boys’ Brigade with
a focus on B.L.O.C.K. and S.A.W. messages, encouraged all students to complete
an SLS lesson on <em>dengue </em>prevention, worked with NParks and Urban
Farm @ Citysprouts to reduce stagnant water in their community gardens
and conducted outreach to nearby residents and a kindergarten.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Furthermore, the team also recognised that mosquito breeding could arise
from poor housekeeping in homes. The team conducted assembly talks to encourage
their peers to check their homes for potential breeding habitats and at
the same time, recycle or donate items which could be reused They organised
a clothes recycling drive and collection of food items for redistribution
in collaboration with Student Leaders. The team upcycled old clothes and
food containers into fruit baskets and redistributed the collected food
items to residents in the neighbourhood. Excess clothes collected were
picked up by partner, Green Sproutz, for further processing.</p>

<p><strong>Ai Tong School – Silver</strong>
<br>The project team carried out a nine-month initiative to educate students
and the community on public hygiene and toilet etiquette. They collaborated
with Primary 5 students as apprentices to create jingles and posters featuring
school and self-designed toilet mascots. These were presented during assembly
sessions using videos, skits, and jingles to emphasise collective efforts
in improving toilet hygiene.</p>
<p>The school-wide engagement included recess activities focused on four
thoughtful toilet habits, interactive games on a website, a toilet comics
challenge, and a pledge campaign. Visual reminders, such as toilet mascot
decals, were placed in toilets, and infra-sensor audio systems played jingles
to reinforce positive behaviour. Morning announcements further reminded
users of thoughtful toilet habits.</p>
<p>The team extended their outreach by partnering with Bishan Community Centre,
Bishan Wellness Hub, and SMRT to share materials promoting good toilet
etiquette, successfully raising awareness and encouraging responsible hygiene
practices in the community.</p>

<p><strong>Pei Hwa Presbyterian Primary School – Bronze</strong>
</p>
<p>The project team from the Student Council embarked on a seven-month project
with monthly meetings to plan school and community outreach, designing
educational materials on anti-littering and brainstormed ideas to make
environmental stewardship more engaging.</p>
<p>The team decided to promote Plogging (jogging while picking litter). In
school-based plogs, general waste and dead leaves for composting were sorted
out as part of Environment Protection. They worked with Bukit Timah Community
Club to run a booth with a 30-second plogging challenge, shared information
about plogging with the community and carried out a plog at PassionArts
Festival at Clementi Firefly Park to model the way for the community and
to practise environmental stewardship.</p>
<p>
<br>Similar activities were carried out in school to educate and engage their
schoolmates about plogging. The team gave a school-wide presentation during
assembly and created a video showing the project progress, team reflections
and to conclude the whole outreach.</p>
