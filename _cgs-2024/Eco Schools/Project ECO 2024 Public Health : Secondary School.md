<h3><strong>Project E.C.O. (Educate. Challenge. Organise.)<br>Public Health Category – Secondary School</strong></h3>
<p><strong>St Andrew's Secondary School – Gold Award</strong>
</p>
<p>The project aimed to achieve an overall improvement in cleanliness of
the school toilets. The students conducted interviews with the school cleaners
and their peers to gain insights before designing posters with targeted
key messages. A sharing was conducted during assembly to reach out to their
peers. The students first conducted research on the importance of promoting
clean public toilets from a wider public perspective. They then conducted
a toilet cleanliness perception survey with their peers. With the information
collected, they tailored their campaign to the needs of their peers, raising
awareness on the importance of clean school toilets.</p>

</p>
<p>Their main approach was to first develop a sense of empathy for school
cleaners in the students and to encourage students to apply what they have
learnt. One noticeable highlight would include the engagement of the whole
school in a Kahoot! game and a mass dance, together with the use of social
media platforms to increase outreach.</p>

outside their classrooms and educate students on proper dengue preventive
measures. Educational posters were created by the students and displayed

engagement skills and creativity.</p>
