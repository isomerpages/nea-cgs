<h3><strong>Project E.C.O 2024 – Public Health - Secondary</strong></h3>
<p><strong>CHIJ St. Joseph’s Convent – Gold</strong>
</p>
<p>The project aimed to foster shared responsibility for cleanliness in the
school canteen. After conducting survey through observations, the team
introduced the "Adopt-a-Table" initiative, where lower Secondary classes
maintained and monitored the cleanliness of their adopted tables, promoting
ownership and shared responsibility rather than reliance on cleaners.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The team introduced the initiative to their peers during assembly, highlighting
the Year of Public Hygiene, their survey findings and their tagline “Return,
Throw, Wipe” to motivate their peers to contribute towards keeping the
canteen clean. As part of the project, each class’s Eco-Steward submitted
photos of their adopted tables for rating, promoting active participation
in canteen cleanliness.</p>
<p>The initiative laid a strong foundation for cultivating student ownership
of the school environment. To build upon current efforts and progress,
the team led a community clean-up activity and proposed strategies such
as a peer monitoring system to encourage collective responsibility that
would extend beyond school to homes and communities.</p>

</p>
<p>The project team’s five-month long project aimed to educate about <em>dengue</em> fever
and its impact on Singapore's public health. Prompted by rising <em>dengue</em> cases,
the team conducted a survey to assess the level of <em>dengue </em>awareness
among the public. The survey found that 50% of respondents felt that it
was important to start educating children from below 10 years old about <em>dengue</em>.
Hence, the team embarked on a project to develop a comprehensive programme
for pre-schoolers</p>

<p>The programme was successfully implemented at New Life Preschool @Bukit
Panjang and included interactive activities such as storytelling, larvae
hunt, colouring activity and quizzes. The children demonstrated increased
understanding of <em>dengue</em> prevention steps. A booklet with information
on <em>dengue</em> prevention was also distributed to the parents.</p>
<p>To further extend their reach within the school community, the team created
an Instagram page and sent schoolwide emails to share about <em>dengue</em> prevention
and public hygiene related messages.</p>

<p>The team planned to share their personal experience and learning points

to create infographics and spread awareness on public health topics via

<p>&nbsp;<strong>Yuan Ching Secondary School – Bronze</strong>
</p>
<p>The project team embarked on two different projects aimed at improving
class cleanliness in school and promoting <em>dengue</em> awareness in the
community.</p>
<p>A Class Cleanliness Competition was organised to foster responsibility
and community ownership. The initiative included an awareness campaign
through school briefing on the current state of cleanliness in classes,
inter-class competitions, and regular assessments. The project aimed to
promote long-term behavioural changes and a lasting impact on school cleanliness
culture.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To raise <em>dengue </em>awareness within the Taman Jurong community, the
team briefed students in the Environmental Science Club and rallied them
to conduct door-to-door visits to distribute informative pamphlets and
repellents to residents. They educated residents on <em>dengue </em>prevention
steps like B.L.O.C.K. and S.A.W. and reached out to 262 units. The team
would continue to explore this outreach as an annual event and tap on social
media platforms (Instagram - @ycss.eclub) to document learnings and inspire
new students to join them.</p>
