<p>This thought-provoking artwork delivers a strong environmental message
through symbolism and emotion. A girl stands before a green bin, reflecting
on the polluted world inside it, highlighting the consequences of waste.
Above her, two posters read “Reuse, Reduce, Recycle” and “Take what you
want, eat what you take,” reminding us to be mindful of our actions. The
muted colours and smoky skyline within the bin create a stark contrast
to the real world, urging viewers to take responsibility. This piece powerfully
encourages sustainable habits and emphasizes that every choice we make
affects the future of our planet.</p>

<p>This artwork is a powerful visual metaphor highlighting the urgent need
to revive and protect our planet. It portrays Earth as a fragile patient
receiving a life-saving IV drip filled with symbols of sustainability like
recycling, planting, and conservation. The oceanic background filled with
coral and marine life entangled in trash, emphasizes the devastating impact
of pollution. Through the contrast between destruction and healing, the
painting calls for collective action and environmental responsibility.
It is a reminder that just as we care for human health, we must also care
for the health of our Earth</p>

<p>This artwork contrasts the impact of disposable versus reusable items.
On the left, a disposable fork and cutlery are shown, alongside a polluted,
dirty lake with dead coral caused by trash in the ocean. On the right,
a reusable spoon and cutlery accompanies a clean lake with thriving coral.
This visual illustrates the consequences of choosing disposables over reusables.
This piece inspires viewers to reduce disposable use and embrace reusables
instead.</p>
