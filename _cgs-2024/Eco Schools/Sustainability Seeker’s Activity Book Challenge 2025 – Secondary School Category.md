<p><strong>Sustainability Seeker’s Activity Book Challenge 2025! </strong>drew
over 160 students to design an engaging, informative, and visually appealing
activity booklet to engage their peers to take actions for the environment.
Students from Secondary Schools to Junior Colleges created content to engage
peers and the community on how they can minimise usage of disposables,
reduce food waste in school and at home, and encourage them to take action
etc.</p>
<p><strong>Theme: Reducing usage of disposables and food wastage</strong>
</p>
<p>The theme for the activity booklet focused on waste reduction, exploring
ways to minimise usage of disposable items and/or reduce food waste. Participating
teams engaged their peers and communities with interactive challenges that
convey waste reduction messages, fun facts and hacks for sustainable living
and creative ways to encourage them to take action.</p>

<p>The project team wanted their activity book to be simple, fun yet meaningful
in its impact. While strategically planning the content, they focused on
daily habits that students could easily relate to, such as using plastic
bags, wasting food during recess, or throwing away things that could still
be reused — turning everyday moments into learning opportunities.</p>
<p>The activities are hands-on and easy to follow. They included engaging
quizzes, creative drawings and mini challenges so readers could learn through
active participation rather than passive reading, creating a more effective
educational experience.</p>
<p>The team's central message was that even small actions can help the environment.
Simple choices like saying no to disposables, finishing your food or choosing
to reuse items can make a substantial difference when everyone puts in
the effort. This approach demonstrates how individual actions, when multiplied
across a community, can drive real environmental change.</p>
