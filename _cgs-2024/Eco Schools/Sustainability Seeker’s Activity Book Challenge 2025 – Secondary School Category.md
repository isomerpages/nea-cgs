<p><strong>Sustainability Seeker’s Activity Book Challenge 2025! </strong>drew
over 160 students to design an engaging, informative, and visually appealing
activity booklet to engage their peers to take actions for the environment.
Students from Secondary Schools to Junior Colleges created content to engage
peers and the community on how they can minimise usage of disposables,
reduce food waste in school and at home, and encourage them to take action
etc.</p>
<p><strong>Theme: Reducing usage of disposables and food wastage</strong>
</p>
<p>The theme for the activity booklet focused on waste reduction, exploring
ways to minimise usage of disposable items and/or reduce food waste. Participating
teams engaged their peers and communities with interactive challenges that
convey waste reduction messages, fun facts and hacks for sustainable living
and creative ways to encourage them to take action.</p>

<p>The project team wanted their activity book to be simple, fun yet meaningful
in its impact. While strategically planning the content, they focused on
daily habits that students could easily relate to, such as using plastic
bags, wasting food during recess, or throwing away things that could still
be reused — turning everyday moments into learning opportunities.</p>
<p>The activities are hands-on and easy to follow. They included engaging
quizzes, creative drawings and mini challenges so readers could learn through
active participation rather than passive reading, creating a more effective
educational experience.</p>
<p>The team's central message was that even small actions can help the environment.
Simple choices like saying no to disposables, finishing your food or choosing
to reuse items can make a substantial difference when everyone puts in
the effort. This approach demonstrates how individual actions, when multiplied
across a community, can drive real environmental change.</p>

<p>The project team began by researching Singapore's waste problem on Clean
&amp; Green Singapore website. They wanted to create something fun, relatable,
and informative for their schoolmates. After brainstorming, they divided
the tasks based on their individual strengths in writing, drawing, and
designing using Canva. Each activity was thoughtfully crafted to reflect
everyday situations students face, such as packing for school, shopping,
or eating lunch. Their aim was to encourage simple swaps, like choosing
a reusable bottle instead of plastic.</p>
<p>The team tested the booklet with their peers, who completed activities
like the maze and quiz. The feedback they received helped them improve
the design and make the instructions clearer.</p>
<p>Their focus was on minimising disposables, and they hope this booklet
would inspire students to take action in small but impactful ways. From
illustrations to layout, everything was developed collaboratively as a
team to promote sustainability in an engaging and creative way.</p>

<p>This attractive activity booklet was designed to engage fellow students
in a fun, hands-on way while reinforcing the importance of reducing disposables
and food waste. Inspired by game-like tasks and relatable trends, each
page encourages students to reflect on and improve their daily habits through
the 4Rs: Reset, Recondition, Restore, Rejoice. Central to the project team's
message was that change starts with small, consistent actions — like using
reusable cutlery or taking only what one can finish.</p>
<p>To make sustainability more personal and empowering, they introduced the
"ABCs of Sustainability Superheroes" – Adventurous – try new ways to reuse
and repurpose; Benevolent – share food and care for others and the planet;
Charismatic – lead by inspiring peers through positive actions.</p>
<p>By combining creativity, self-awareness, and engaging challenges like
the #ZeroWasteGlowUp, the booklet aims to nurture a new generation of eco-conscious
changemakers who see sustainability as both achievable and exciting.</p>
