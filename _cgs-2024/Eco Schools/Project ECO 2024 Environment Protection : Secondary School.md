<p><strong>Naval Base Secondary School – Bronze</strong>
<br>
<br>The project aimed to raise awareness about reducing textile and paper
waste in the school and local community through hands-on upcycling activities.</p>
<p>Eco Ambassadors repurposed old textiles into useful items, i.e tote bags,
while Secondary 3 Eco Board Councillors taught 50 kindergarten students,
staff, and parents from PCF Sparkletots&nbsp;how to upcycle clothes into
bracelets during their Environment Fest.</p>
<p>Students also processed recycled paper into eco-friendly Teacher’s Day
gifts, promoting sustainability. The project successfully engaged participants
in creative upcycling, fostering environmental stewardship and awareness
about the impact of waste.</p>
