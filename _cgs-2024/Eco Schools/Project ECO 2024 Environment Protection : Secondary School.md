<h3><strong>Project E.C.O. (Educate. Challenge. Organise.)<br>Environment Protection Category – Secondary School</strong></h3>

<p><em>Incorporating the Eco-Hub@Springfield into the canteen as a one-stop recycling point and venue for mini-workshops to engage students on eco-stewardship related activities.</em>
</p>
<p>Strategies included setting up an Eco-Hub on school premises (which comprised
the recycling bins for plastics, papers, shoes, e-waste, collection of
reusable bags), conducting educational programs and holding recycling games.
The project used the Design Thinking methodology and conducted research
through observations and surveys. The implemented solutions, such as the
Eco-Hub and Humanities Week activities, were effective in increasing recycling
rates in the school.</p>

<p><strong>Clementi Town Secondary School – Silver Award</strong>
</p>
<p>The Environment Champions organised various initiatives to promote environmental
awareness and sustainability. This included observing Earth Hour, where
students learned about the importance of conserving energy and combating
climate change via activities such as turning off lights and fans when
not in use, quizzes and pledges.</p>
<p>Additionally, they also organised an Ang Bao collection drive during Chinese
New Year to collect and recycle unused red packets, with the aim of reducing
waste. A team of students also participated in the National Youth Upcycling
Movement, creating upcycled household storage box and teaching younger
students about sustainability.</p>

<p><em>Collection of used and empty red packets which were delivered to the nearest DBS branch for recycling.</em>
</p>
<p>Awareness on the importance of environmental sustainability was further
promoted in various Values-in-Action (VIA) programmes. For example, a group
of students initiated a food drive to collect and donate soon-to-expire
food items to Food Bank Singapore.</p>

NEWBitumen in an environmentally safe way to construct greener roads.</p>
