<h3><strong>Project E.C.O 2024 - Environment Protection - Secondary</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Saint Andrew’s Secondary School – Gold</strong>
</p>
<p>The project aimed to advocate recycling and foster environmental responsibility
within the school community. Students researched and developed strategies
to promote recycle right habits and reduction of plastic waste.</p>
<p>Student-led initiatives included creation of posters to place around the
school, hosting regular morning assembly announcements, organising campaign
such as "Skip the Straw Day", collaborating with canteen vendors to reduce
plastic waste by not providing straws and to further raise awareness about
the challenges of recycling due to contamination.

<p><strong>Naval Base Secondary School – Bronze</strong>
<br>
<br>The project aimed to raise awareness about reducing textile and paper
waste in the school and local community through hands-on upcycling activities.</p>
<p>Eco Ambassadors repurposed old textiles into useful items, i.e tote bags,
while Secondary 3 Eco Board Councillors taught 50 kindergarten students,
staff, and parents from PCF Sparkletots&nbsp;how to upcycle clothes into
bracelets during their Environment Fest.</p>
<p>Students also processed recycled paper into eco-friendly Teacher’s Day
gifts, promoting sustainability. The project successfully engaged participants
in creative upcycling, fostering environmental stewardship and awareness
about the impact of waste.</p>
