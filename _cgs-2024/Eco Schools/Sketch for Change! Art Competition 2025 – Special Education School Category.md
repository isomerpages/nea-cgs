<p>This powerful artwork shows Earth with a sad face, surrounded by food
waste like fruit, snacks, and vegetables. The scattered items serve as
a reminder of how much food is thrown away every day. When we waste food,
we’re not just wasting a meal—we’re wasting the water, energy, and hard
work that went into growing, harvesting, and bringing that food to us.
Food waste also contributes to pollution and harms our environment. Let’s
make Earth happy again by taking only what we need, finishing our meals,
and keeping our leftovers for later. Every little action counts. Together,
we can reduce food waste and care for our planet.</p>

<p>This artwork depicts a pizza with hands reaching out to grab it, reminding
us to share food rather than throwing it away. Too many people discard
food that could still be eaten or given to someone else. The choices we
make can help reduce food waste. When we waste food, we’re not just wasting
money- we are also hurting our planet. This drawing encourages us to take
only what we can finish and share what’s leftover with others. Share your
slice, do not let it go to waste!</p>
