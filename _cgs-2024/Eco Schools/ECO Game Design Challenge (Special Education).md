<h1>ECO-Game Design Challenge</h1>
<p><strong>Cerebral Palsy Alliance Singapore School (West) </strong>– 1<sup>st</sup> Prize&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Name of Game</strong>: Urgent Business</p>
<p><strong>Write up:</strong> A playful twist on Snakes and Ladders, the game
“Urgent Business” was designed to promote awareness of public restroom
cleanliness. Players navigated a board where toilet paper replaced snakes,
and dirty toilets replaced ladders. Educational cards provided practical
hygiene tips, highlighted common mistakes, and guided player’s movement,
making the experience interactive and memorable. This approach encouraged
good hygiene habits and fostered a greater understanding of maintaining
clean public restrooms.</p>
