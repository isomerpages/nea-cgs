<p><strong>GIG International School – </strong>2<sup>nd</sup> Prize</p>
<p><strong>Name of video</strong>: Return Your Tray, Make Kindness the Way!</p>
<p><em>Video to be embedded:</em>  <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKD1nI3roZ8</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;The students observed that many of their peers assumed that cleaners
were responsible for clearing trays from the tables at eating places.,</p>
<p>The students reflected on how to raise awareness amongst their peers about
public hygiene and how returning trays helped create a cleaner environment.
The students created a video aimed to spread awareness of the importance
of tray return as beyond keeping eating places clean but as an act of social
responsibility, kindness to others, and respect toward cleaners.</p>

</p>
<p>The video conveyed the importance of public hygiene through anti-littering,
clean public toilet, and tray return. By showing how small actions could
benefit the environment, the students aimed to encourage people to start
incorporating these simple acts in their daily lives.</p>
<p>Furthermore, through the video, the students show how one’s small negative
action could impact the environment.</p>
