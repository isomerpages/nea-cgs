<h3><strong>Project E.C.O. (Educate. Challenge. Organise.)<br>Public Health Category – Primary School</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Unity Primary School – Gold Award</strong>
</p>
<p>The team embarked on a 6-month project, dedicating their efforts to heighten
dengue prevention awareness in both the school and the community, with
the aim of reducing dengue cases in the neighbourhood. Executing a two-tier
strategy, the team first created a dengue prevention video, involving their
school mascot. The video was shared during assembly, and the team reiterated
the importance of collective efforts in dengue prevention. Environmental
booths were set up during the annual Science &amp; Green Carnival to further
engage the school community in dengue prevention and environmental conservation
through interactive games, quizzes, and flyers.</p>

</p>
<p>To extend their reach to the community, the team designed post cards and
distributed them to residents during the annual Estate Collection Day.
Partnering students from the PCF kindergarten, the team conducted house
visits to educate residents on the B-L-O-C-K steps. The project had successfully
heightened awareness in the residents to take dengue preventive measures.</p>

<p><em>Keep Xishan Clean video production.</em>
</p>
<p>The ideation resulted in a creative solution: the ‘Keep Xishan Clean’
song and skit, which aimed to encourage peers to maintain cleanliness within
the school and community areas. The team created a 7-minute video, emphasizing
the importance of cleanliness, proper litter disposal, clearing food remnants,
and returning crockery. The video was showcased to Primary 4 students before
their Value-In-Action (VIA) litter-picking activity.</p>

<p><strong>Clementi Primary School – Bronze Award</strong>
</p>
<p>Student environmental leaders imparted knowledge gained from their participation
in Project E.C.O. workshops to the school’s Environmental Club members
as well as members of the public.</p>
<p>The project team focused on the topic of dengue prevention, aligned with
the P3 Science topic on mosquitoes' life cycle. Noticing the peak dengue
period and surge in dengue cases in the 2nd half of 2023, the team kickstarted
a project via a two-step approach.</p>
<p>Firstly, engaging their peers via a presentation on dengue prevention,
creating an interactive online game booklet and quiz, as well as 3D models
of an Aedes mosquito using recycled materials.</p>
