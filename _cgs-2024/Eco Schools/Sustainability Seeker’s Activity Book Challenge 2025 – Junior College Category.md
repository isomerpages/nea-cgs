<p><strong>Sustainability Seeker’s Activity Book Challenge 2025! </strong>drew
over 160 students to design an engaging, informative, and visually appealing
activity booklet to engage their peers to take actions for the environment.
Students from Secondary Schools to Junior Colleges created content to engage
peers and the community on how they can minimise usage of disposables,
reduce food waste in school and at home, and encourage them to take action
etc.</p>
<p><strong>Theme: Reducing usage of disposables and food wastage</strong>
</p>
<p>The theme for the activity booklet focused on waste reduction, exploring
ways to minimise usage of disposable items and/or reduce food waste. Participating
teams engaged their peers and communities with interactive challenges that
convey waste reduction messages, fun facts and hacks for sustainable living
and creative ways to encourage them to take action.</p>

<p>The project team crafted their unique activity booklet around Sir Racky
Bartholomew — a sarcastic, sassy and slightly grumpy raccoon who rules
over Semakau Island, home to farmer raccoons growing food for Singapore.
Unlike generic mascots, Racky's cuteness and savage commentary keep fellow
students engaged whilst teaching them about food waste and disposable overuse.
His mission? To guide readers on a hilariously insightful journey towards
earning the title: "Not a Trash Human".</p>
<p>The team recognised that their audience had seen their fair share of sustainability
campaigns, so they decided to incorporate satire and relatability into
their activity booklet to make it more engaging. Activities such as "Are
You a Trash Human?" quizzes, meal-packing challenges, comic strips, and
consequence-based games deliver serious messages through fun, gamified
everyday scenarios without the guilt trip. By blending comedy, interactivity,
and real-life scenarios, their booklet delivers genuine environmental messages
and encourages sustainable habits in a way that sticks.</p>

<p>This vibrant activity booklet was specially designed to engage students
from lower primary (P1-P3) through interactive and visually appealing content.
The project team's goal was to create a fun yet educational tool — engaging
activities like crosswords, mini comic strips, and short write-ups were
thoughtfully crafted to reinforce important messages about reducing food
waste.</p>
<p>In addition, the team focused on promoting easy-to-adopt actions such
as 'make your own' compost, making sustainability feel accessible and achievable
for young learners. Through this approach, they aimed to encourage a meaningful
shift in mindset through small, consistent choices. In doing so, they hope
that their booklet would not only educate but also empower children to
become confident, responsible stewards of the environment in their everyday
lives.</p>

<p>The project team's activity booklet aims to make learning about waste
reduction fun, simple and actionable. It starts off with a modified version
of the classic Snake and Ladder game to teach players fun facts and bite-sized
tips to reduce waste. The second activity, Cook a Dish, suggests recipes
promoting creative usage of leftovers in cooking to reduce wastage. Their
third activity teaches participants the basic principles of waste sorting
and composting, an important yet often overlooked aspect of waste reduction.
The final activity is an interactive Bingo challenge that motivates participants
to put waste-reducing tips they learnt into practice over a period of 30
days.</p>
<p>Overall, the team hope to show that reducing waste does not require drastic
changes, but small, mindful actions. They wanted to encourage their peers
and their families to think twice before generating waste, be more aware
of the waste problem globally and to pick up waste-reducing habits.</p>
