<h3>Launch of Cora Environment Smart Recycling Hub at Mee Toh School&nbsp;</h3>
<p>On 6 October 2025, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for the Ministry of
Sustainability and the Environment &amp; for the Ministry of Culture, Community
and Youth, Ms Goh Hanyan, joined the Launch of REHub for Cora School Recycling
League at Mee Toh School. SPS was joined by the Group CEO of Cora Environment,
Mr Lee Kok Kin, and Mee Toh School Principal, Mr Kelvin Tay.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This event was organized by Cora Environment as part of the School Recycling
League (SRL), a key initiative supporting Singapore’s Green Plan to raise
recycling rates and reduce landfill waste.</p>
<p>In 2024, participating schools collected 15 tonnes of clean, source-segregated
recyclables – including paper, glass, plastics, metals and e-waste – and
helped divert 59 kg CO₂ from landfills and incineration. Schools participating
in Cora SRL in 2025 has collected more than double the amount of recyclables
so far.</p>
<p>Mee Toh School was selected to launch the first REHub in recognition of
its achievement as the gold award winner of the SRL’s primary school category
in 2024. The REHub launch at Mee Toh symbolises the collaboration between
schools and corporate partners to promote sustainable living in the community.</p>
<p>The REHub, launched by SPS, is located at the school foyer, and features
four compartments for paper, metal cans, plastic bottles, and drink cartons.
Each bin is equipped with a smart sensor that tracks data in real time
and alerts Cora Environment when it reaches 80% capacity, to streamline
collection. These REHubs will boost the SRL’s efforts as they are rolled
out progressively.</p>
<p>In addition to the REHub launch, SPS addressed about 900 upper primary
students at the morning assembly. Joined on stage by Mr Lee, Mr Tay and
five environmental champions, she engaged in a lively Q&amp;A, fielding
students’ questions about sustainability. The students even posed questions
to each other, promoting peer learning.</p>
<p>SPS also visited 8 student booths where Primary Three students showcased
their class artwork, which was created entirely from discarded items. The
students transformed trash into treasure, demonstrating the creativity
and resourcefulness. The students even quizzed SPS on her environmental
knowledge, showing that we are never too young or too old to learn more
about the environment.</p>
<h3><br>International E-Waste Day 2025</h3>
<p>International E-Waste Day is organised annually to raise public awareness
on e-waste recycling and to encourage members of the public to recycle
their e-waste. The theme for IEWD 2025 was ‘Step Up E-waste Recycling’,
focusing on encouraging habitual recycling by improving accessibility to
collection points and making it easy to locate e-waste bins via the ALBA’s
revamped Step Up mobile app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Co-organised by the National Environment Agency and ALBA E-Waste Smart
Recycling, the appointed operator of the Producer Responsibility Scheme
for E-Waste, the event was launched by Dr Janil Puthucheary, Senior Minister
of State for Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment and Ministry
of Education, on 12 October 2025 at Bedok Town Square.</p>
<p>The event marked a significant milestone where the number of collection
points increased from 300 in 2021 to 1000 this year, making it more convenient
for the public to recycle their e-waste. Commemorating the occasion, a
“Design Our 1,000th E-Waste Bin Competition” was organised and winning
entries recognised at IEWD 2025.</p>
<h3><br>Race to Sustainability! 2025&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Since its launch in 2015, <em>Race to Sustainability!</em> has been Gardens
by the Bay’s signature post-examination programme, engaging students through
fun, interactive activities that promote care for the environment. The
event has grown over the years to become a key platform for raising awareness
about nature, climate change, and sustainable living.</p>
<p>This year, more than 4,000 attendees, including students and teachers
from 17 primary and secondary schools, were involved in the two-day race
on 21 and 23 October 2025. Students worked in teams and raced through various
stations across the Gardens, solving puzzles and completing challenges
that encouraged them to think critically about environmental issues and
everyday actions they could take to make a difference.</p>
<p>A key highlight this year was the exclusive SG60<strong> </strong>Comic
Trail, featuring 10 larger-than-life comic panels conceptualised and designed
by local sustainability champion Biogirl MJ. The comic trail showcased
diverse elements of sustainability in Singapore – from the OneMillionTrees
movement and hornbill conservation, to solar-powered Supertrees and water-saving
ecosystems – all conveyed in a light-hearted and enjoyable way for students.
Nine public agencies – National Environment Agency, Building and Construction
Authority, Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore, Housing and Development
Board, Land Transport Authority, Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore,
Monetary Authority of Singapore, Singapore Food Agency and Urban Redevelopment
Authority – also showcased interactive installations that highlighted Singapore’s
collective efforts in building a green nation. Members of the public also
enjoyed the comics and installations and participated in nature and sustainability-themed
talks and workshops.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The event was organised in partnership with the National Environment Agency
and other partners, reflecting a shared commitment to nurturing a generation
that values and protects the environment. By combining play with education, <em>Race to Sustainability!</em> encouraged
participants to see themselves as part of the solution to today’s environmental
challenges. This collaborative effort with Gardens by the Bay helped play
an important role in supporting Singapore’s vision of a Clean and Green
Singapore, helping young people and the wider community take meaningful
steps towards building a sustainable future.</p>
<h3>Eco Paddle with Ola Makes Waves for Marine Conservation at Siloso Beach</h3>
<p>
<br>On Saturday 25 October 2025, Siloso Beach in Sentosa came alive with purpose
and passion as Eco Paddle with Ola took centre stage, highlighting the
important mission of marine conservation and environmental stewardship.
Co-organised by Ola Beach Club and the National Environment Agency, this
vibrant event united community spirit with action to tackle marine litter
hands-on.</p>
<p>The event was graced by Minister for Sustainability and the Environment
and Minister-in-Charge of Trade Relations, Ms Grace Fu, who joined 80 dedicated
corporate partners, NGOs, YES Leaders, and migrant workers in a collaborative
effort to help keep Singapore’s waters pristine. Together, participants
took to kayaks and patrolled the shores of Sentosa to remove as much marine
litter as they could.&nbsp; Together, they helped make a tangible impact
on the local ecosystem.</p>
<p>Adding a creative twist to conservation, attendees also participated in
an engaging upcycling workshop, transforming the very marine debris they
collected into one-of-a-kind keychains and accessories.&nbsp; The workshop
was a powerful reminder of how waste can be given new life. Minister Fu
also toured the Sentosa Sustainability Travelling Exhibition, a mobile
educational truck that brings sustainability education directly to communities.
The truck features four interactive quests: Travel Well (greener transport
options like cycling trails and electric shuttles), Play Well (responsible
leisure through nature tours and eco-activities like the gravity-powered
luge), Eat Well (sustainable dining choices), and Stay Well (eco-friendly
daily habits).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since May 2025, ongoing kayak litter picking sessions have engaged participants
in marine coastal cleanup efforts, with strong support from Ola Beach Club
through NEA's Clean and Green Singapore Experiences programme. Additional
sessions in November and December 2025 will provide more opportunities
for public participation. These hands-on sessions allow participants to
contribute to a cleaner environment whilst learning sustainable practices.
Interested individuals can register for upcoming sessions through the

<p>More than just a one-off activity, Eco Paddle with Ola is an invitation
to everyone to join the movement towards cleaner seas and a greener future.</p>
