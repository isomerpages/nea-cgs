<h4>What got me started?</h4>
<p>I’ve always been interested in nature and the environment since young,
and have always wanted to do my part for the environment, but&nbsp; I didn’t
know how to get started.</p>
<p>It was only when I&nbsp;was researching on&nbsp; healthier plant-based
diets for my family that I learnt how healthy and nutritious food is being&nbsp;
thrown away every day. To me, it seems silly and a waste of money to be
throwing away food that’s still perfectly edible, just because they were
bruised or discoloured.</p>
<p>When we throw away food, we are also wasting precious natural resources
- water and energy, that’s been invested into growing the produce that
eventually gets served up on our tables.&nbsp;Resources are finite, especially
so in Singapore, where we have limited space to build incineration plants
or landfills to dispose of food waste.</p>
<h4>What was your first project?</h4>
<p>I started reading up on healthier diets when my mom was diagnosed with
breast cancer. Through my research, I learnt that, a lot of nutritious
food was being thrown away due to cosmetic filtering.</p>
<p>Hence, I collect these “ugly” and blemished food that would otherwise
be disposed of from fruits and vegetable suppliers and improvise new recipes
with them.</p>

<h4>What’s next?</h4>
<p>I hope to see more people in my community take small steps where they
can, to adopt a greener lifestyle. Generally, I feel that Singaporeans
do want to adopt more eco-friendly habits, but are unaware of how to get
started, and may feel left out if people around them do not support their
efforts . The first step is to overcome the inertia of being the “first
person to make the change” and start practising simple habits to reduce
food waste such as ordering only what we can finish or asking for less
where necessary.</p>
<p>The next step is to spread the awareness on what are the small steps each
of us can take as individuals and how these&nbsp;small steps can impact
the environment in big ways.</p>
<p>If each of us can influence just one person, that would be a great start.
<br>I’ve chosen to do&nbsp;what’s&nbsp;good for&nbsp;me&nbsp;and the&nbsp;environment.</p>
<p>You can too.</p>
