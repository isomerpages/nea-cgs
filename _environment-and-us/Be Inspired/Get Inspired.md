<p></p>
<p>Like many others, Sofia was always refreshing her wardrobe by purchasing
new clothes. However, she came to realise that she was often buying more
than she needed, leaving most of her items being simply chucked aside in
a corner, or worse, thrown away and adding to Singapore’s waste. Today,
she is her own creative director – attending clothes-swapping events to
exchange her old clothes for pre-loved ones. This means Sofia has to get
extra creative with her styling, as she has to work with what she finds.
At the end of day, this sustainable habit helps her to reduce waste at
the same time.</p>
