<p><strong>What got me started?</strong>
</p>
<p>In the past, I was often buying more than I needed. Before I knew it,
I ended up with a ton of clothes that get simply chucked aside after a
couple of wears. Until, I discovered clothes swapping. It’s a simple yet
beneficial practice: You exchange your old clothes for pre-loved ones.
It’s a fun way to refresh my wardrobe without expanding it or throwing
any clothes away. This requires me to be creative with my styling, as I
have to work with what I find. Sometimes, it even feels like a treasure
hunt!</p>
<p><strong>What was your first project?</strong>
</p>
<p>I took up a module in school which deepened my understanding of our relationship
with nature and the environment. It was then that I came to understand
the impact that excessive clothes consumption has on our world.</p>
<p>I began making green changes to my lifestyle to enable myself to go waste-free
and minimise my negative impact on the environment. One of my discoveries
was a clothes-swapping event at a sustainability festival in January 2018.</p>
<p>Now, instead of buying new clothes, I opt for second-hand ones from sustainable
fashion shops. I am even thinking of holding a clothes swap with friends
and families for Hari Raya Puasa, to encourage others to swap for new Raya
outfits rather than purchase them!</p>

<p><strong>What’s next?</strong>
</p>
<p>I hope to encourage people to adopt a zero-waste lifestyle by starting
small. There are different ways to do it! Connect with people who are in
the know and get tips for reducing waste from them. Approach reducing waste
with an open mind – you may end up finding it enjoyable, such as in the
case of the exciting and experiential activity of clothes swapping. It
can be a fun and easy starting point in the gradual journey towards a zero-waste
lifestyle.</p>
<p>You don’t need to make a big change to your lifestyle to make a difference.</p>
<p>Even a decision as small as choosing to clothes swap can help satisfy
your urge to shop, in a way that’s friendly on your wallet and the environment
too! It even helps you meet like-minded individuals and communities.</p>
<p>You’ll find a great sense of freedom that can change the way you see the
world and kick-start your journey towards a zero-waste lifestyle.</p>
<p>I’ve chosen to do&nbsp;what’s&nbsp;good for&nbsp;me&nbsp;and the&nbsp;environment.</p>
<p>You can too.</p>
