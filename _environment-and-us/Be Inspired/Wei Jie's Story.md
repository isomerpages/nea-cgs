<p><strong>What got me started?</strong>
</p>
<p>I like how coffee connects people and often ponder about the lack of interaction
between people with special needs and mainstream society. Marrying these
two notions, Foreword Coffee was born.</p>
<p>I didn’t want to just run a coffee company, unless I could do something
more and worthwhile with it. What if every cup could help change things?
What if it could do more for the Earth too?</p>
<p>On top of employing people with special needs, I also wanted the business
to do good for the environment. I realised that I could actually do something
about the large amount of waste produced by the café industry from using
single-use disposable cups.</p>
<p><strong>What was your first project?</strong>
</p>
<p>Foreword Coffee was incorporated in April 2017, with its first outlet
at NUS. We’ve since moved to Civil Service College, and expanded to a second
outlet at the Centre for Healthcare Innovation. As a young coffee company,
we have experimented with a range of initiatives, just to see what works
for both my business and the environment.</p>
<p>Since our first day of business, we’ve been implementing a “Bring Your
Own Cup” policy, where customers get 10% off if they bring their own cups.
Here at Foreword Coffee, we also allow customers who are staff working
in the building to borrow our dine-in cups and return at their convenience
before we close for the day. For cold takeaway orders, we shy away from
using plastic cups and serve them in paper cups with lids; this eliminates
the need for straws. If we have to use single-use disposable cups to serve
our drinks, we avoid putting on the lids. This leaves our customers to
decide if they really need that extra piece of plastic over the cup and
they can help themselves to the lids. As much as possible, we try to nudge
our customers into doing what’s good for the environment.</p>

<p><strong>What’s next?</strong>
</p>
<p>Personally, I feel that Singaporeans are generally aware of sustainable
products and lifestyles, but often think that adopting them will be inconvenient
and disruptive to their routines.
<br>Leveraging on Foreword Coffee as a platform, I hope to share with fellow
Singaporeans that by taking simple steps like changing our daily drinking
habits, we can easily do our part for the environment that we live in.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, it may be a simple cup of coffee. But I hope that
through each drink, we can gradually reduce our reliance on disposables
and do our bit for the world that we live in.</p>
<p>I’ve chosen to do what’s good for me and the environment.</p>
<p>You can too.</p>
