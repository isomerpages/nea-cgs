<p>In 2022, Singapore generated 813,000 tonnes of food waste. However, only
18% of this, comprising mostly homogeneous by-products from food manufacturing
processes, was recycled. The remaining food waste was incinerated at waste-to-energy
plants with non-food waste.</p>
<p>In response to this pressing issue, DBS Foundation and the National Environment
Agency (NEA) launched the inaugural Hungry for Change Challenge in 2022,
to empower youth to develop and pilot innovative solutions that will prevent
and/or reduce food waste in Singapore.</p>
<p>This year, the Challenge has expanded to involve corporate partners Koufu,
McDonald’s and The Social Kitchen, as well as tackle the issue of food
packaging, which makes up about one-third of domestic waste disposed in
Singapore. The partners have helped to co-develop the Challenge’s problem
statements, with the aim of helping find innovative solutions to manage
both food and food packaging waste. The partners will also work with the
selected teams to pilot their solutions.</p>
<p>In this 2<sup>nd</sup> edition of the Challenge, the project teams with
the five most innovative and impactful ideas around reimaging and reducing
food and packaging waste will receive total funding of up to SGD 125,000
from DBS Foundation. The teams will also receive mentorship from DBS and
have opportunities to consult with NEA and our corporate partners, and
benefit from their expertise.</p>
