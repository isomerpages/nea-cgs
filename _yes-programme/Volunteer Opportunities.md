<p>Green Nudge is a social enterprise which works together with businesses
and communities to support their journeys in becoming more sustainable.
As an initiative to meet the growing demand for green jobs dealing in fields
such as sustainability and climate change, Green Nudge launched a green

<p>Green Collar works towards a sustainable future by matching sustainability-related
jobs between forward-looking employers and job seeking individuals. This
not only assists job seekers by compiling green jobs, making them more
accessible and visible, but also assists employers by connecting them with
talents in the green industries.</p>

<p>Mono&nbsp;Foods is a social enterprise which seeks to reduce food waste
by diverting food items that are near the best-before date from the bin.
We redistribute these food&nbsp;items and educate&nbsp;the public about
best-before dates at&nbsp;Yue Hwa @ Chinatown and pop-up booths (e.g. Zero
waste market). We also donate these items to residents at&nbsp;rental flats
and community centres.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Call for volunteers</u></strong>
</p>
<p>We are looking for volunteers to support our operations and educate the
public about food waste at Yue Hwa @ Chinatown and events.&nbsp;We value
every helping hand and our volunteers span across all age groups and walks
of life!&nbsp;</p>

<p>People’s Association Youth Movement (PAYM) is a core youth movement in
Singapore that aims to build a connected and active youth community through
the strategy of ‘Youth for Youth, Youth for Community’. PAYM provides platforms
for youth to develop themselves and fulfil their aspiration for the community
via a myriad of diverse and holistic programme.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>In line with&nbsp; youths’ growing interest on environment and sustainability
matters, we have initiated a <strong>PAYM50Green Campaign </strong>&nbsp;to
support our Youth Networks in organising ground-up initiatives across Singapore
in three main areas, projects relating to the 5Rs (Recycle, Reuse, Reduce,
Refuse, Rot); community clean-up; and coastal clean-up with kayaking.</p>
