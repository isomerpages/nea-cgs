<p>Singapore has designated 2019 as the Year Towards Zero Waste, aiming to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Raise awareness</strong> of waste issues in Singapore</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rally</strong> the public to treasure our precious resources</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Build </strong>a strong 3R (Reduce, Reuse and Recycle) culture
in Singapore</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Towards Zero Waste is a goal where resources are not discarded after having
served their initial purpose, but are instead treasured and cycled back
into use through reuse (e.g. repair, repurposing) and recycling.</p>
