<p>“Stella! STELLA!” A voice called. Stella turned around to see her best
friend, Linda, catching up to her. As she watched, a blue blur light sped
past Linda and screeched to a stop. Her second best friend, Talia, stepped
off her ultramarine scooter, grinning. Linda came to a stop in front of
them both, panting.</p>
<p>“Girls!” she gasped. “Rumor—ghost—bathroom—”</p>
<p>“Whoa, Linda,” Talia said. “Take a breath! We do NOT want you to faint
on us, trust me.”</p>
<p>Linda gulped down several lungfuls of air before she was able to speak
again. “There are rumors saying that the toilet on the fifth floor is haunted.
Sounds like a job for us, huh?”</p>
<p>One thing special about these three girls was that they were actually
ghostbusters in stealth mode. Stella nodded. “Meet here at midnight tonight.
We’ve got some ghostbusting to do.”</p>
<p>That night, the three ghostbusters snuck into the school and made their
way up to the fifth floor.</p>
<p>They opened the toilet door and…“Eww! This place is DISGUSTING!” Linda
said, wrinkling up her nose. “Disgusting” was an understatement. It smelled
like a dead elephant rotting at midday in the Sahara Desert. There was
water all over the floor, toilets that had never been flushed, used tissues
all over the floor, and toilet seats stained with yellow and brown stuff.
Stella did not want to find out what that was.</p>
<p>She could feel her friends gripping her arms.</p>
<p>“Stella…” Talia whispered. “Look up…” Her voice was trembling like Stella
had never heard it before. She raised her head to see a horrifying sight.
A girl, pale as a sheet, with black holes for eyes and long black hair,
emerged from a tap on the sink. Her nails were an inch long.</p>
<p>“WHOOOO DAAARESS TO DISTUURB MEEE?” the ghost girl wailed. Linda took
a step back, tugging her friends with her.</p>
<p>“N-n-n-no one,” she squeaked. “Please don’t kill us.”</p>
<p>“Or haunt us for the rest of life,” Talia added.</p>
<p>“GEET OUUUT OR ELSE,” the ghost said.</p>
<p>“We just want to ask some questions,” Stella said, even though her heart
felt like it was going to burst right out of her chest. She desperately
wanted to get out, but she wanted to find out what happened to this poor
girl.</p>
<p>“Why are you… like this?” Stella asked.</p>
<p>At this, the ghost started crying into her hands. “No one has ever asked
me that question before,” she sobbed. “No one comes to clean this place,
not even the cleaners. The toilet seats are filthy, the toilet is never
fully flushed, the floor is extremely wet and the trash is absolutely everywhere!
The stench is so bad that I can smell it, and I’m a ghost! And then one
day when I came here to use the restroom, the door locked behind me and
trapped me in here. And because no one comes in here, I died of thirst
and came back as a ghost.”</p>
<p>The girl finished.</p>
<p>The three ghostbusters thought for a moment. Finally, Talia offered, “Will
it help you if we organise an event to clean up the bathroom?” The ghost
looked up. “Yes! Please do! She cried happily. Linda grinned. “Then this
is what we will do.”</p>
<p>The next day, Stella, Linda and Talia pasted posters all over the school,
saying, “Help us clean up the 5<sup>th</sup> floor toilet!” The number of
people who had signed up was alarming: half the school had their names
in. In no time at all, the restroom was sparkly clean.</p>
<p>The moral of the story is ‘Teamwork makes the dreamwork!’</p>

<p><strong>The Four Toilet Rules</strong>
</p>
<p>Written by: Wu Xiyu</p>
<p>I am a bathroom stall—only noticed when I don’t close properly. I’m a
wall to lean on, a shield for privacy, an essential part of every school
toilet. We all are: the toilet, the bin, the floor. Essential, but rarely
treated right.</p>
<p>I’m not here to embarrass anyone, just to remind you of the four simple
Toilet Rules:&nbsp;<strong>Keep the seat clean, the floor dry, the rubbish in the bin, and the toilet fully flushed.</strong>
</p>
<p>It all started like this…</p>
<p>The day began like any other, the sound of footsteps echoing before the
door opened. It was Nancy—an older girl with long black hair tied back
in a ponytail. The toilet groaned. “Nancy! I knew it!” She slammed my door,
and I flinched. She barely flushed, splashed water while washing her hands,
and left without a second thought.</p>
<p>“She left my seat dirty and didn’t flush!” the toilet cried.</p>
<p>“She splashed water on me and even dropped a candy wrapper! The bin is
five steps away!” the floor added.</p>
<p>“She ignored me completely!” the rubbish bin exclaimed.</p>
<p>Then, another girl entered, wearing blue-rimmed glasses. “Not again,”
I thought. But instead of ignoring the mess, she picked up the wrapper
and threw it in the bin. The bin practically glowed. She dried the floor
with a paper towel, mumbling about safety. Then she opened my door, looked
at the toilet, flushed it, wiped it down, used it, and flushed again. The
toilet looked brand new. We all stared in disbelief.</p>
<p>Could someone care that much?</p>
<p>From that moment, we pledged to do our best—for her and others like her
who treat us with respect</p>
<p>So please, remember the four Toilet Rules: <strong>Seat clean. Floor dry. Rubbish in the bin. Toilet fully flushed.</strong>
</p>
<p>Follow them, and we’ll keep doing our part too.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;The Magical Toilet (A Lesson About Keeping The Toilet Clean)</strong>
</p>
<p>Written by: Tiffany Charlotte Wisantoso</p>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a boy named Danny. He was a good boy to his
teachers and parents, and he was a kind friend to his friends. However,
Danny had a bad habit. He always forgets to flush the toilet after use
and to keep the toilet seat clean.</p>
<p>One day, while shopping at the supermarket with his mother, Danny needed
the toilet, so he said,” Mum, I need to go to the toilet. Ok?” Danny’s
mother said,” Ok.” Danny went to the toilet and saw that there were no
available cubicles except one. &nbsp;On that cubicle, he saw a sign which
read,” This is a magical toilet.” He went inside, closed the door and used
the toilet anyway.</p>
<p>As usual, he forgot to flush the toilet. Then suddenly, someone said,”
Ah boy ah! Flush me please and keep the toilet seat clean.” Danny looked
around and asked” Who said that?”&nbsp; The toilet replied” It’s me, the
toilet. Can you flush me now please?”</p>
<p>Danny said,” Okay.” Danny asked,” Why do we have to flush the toilet and
wipe the toilet seat?” The toilet said,” So that we can keep it clean,
then other people after you can use it.” Danny said,” Oh, I didn’t know
that.” The toilet said,” It is good that you know now. &nbsp;Remember,
everyone wins when our toilets are clean.”</p>
<p>Danny said,” I will remember that. Bye.” &nbsp;The toilet said,” Bye.”
Danny went out of the toilet cubicle.</p>
<p>When Danny washed his hands and flicked the water on the floor. Someone
said,” Keep the floor dry. Danny said,” Why?” The voice said,” Someone
might slip and fall!” After Danny wiped the floor with a tissue, he left
the tissue on the floor, the voice boomed,” Throw the rubbish in the bin!”</p>
<p>The voice sang to the tune of (Insey Wincy&nbsp; spider) Keep the toilet
clean, Flush the toilet fully, Keep the floor dry, Throw rubbish into the
bin. When Danny completed the four actions, the toilet let him out.</p>
<p>When he went outside, he saw his mother waiting for him. He ran to his
mother and helped her carry the groceries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the way home, he told his mother what had happened and what he had
learned to do from then on. Danny’s mother was super proud of Danny and
she also praised him. Danny decided to become an environment leader and
teach others to keep the toilet clean.</p>

<p><strong>Nobody likes a Dirty Toilet! Not even me.</strong>
</p>
<p>Written by: Sumayyah Binte Mohammad Fauzi</p>
<p>If we don’t keep our toilets clean, we will suffer from the toilet monsters!
The toilet monsters are nice when we keep the toilets clean but mean when
we don’t take care of the toilets.</p>
<p>Let me introduce you to the different types of monsters. Let’s start with
the floor and toilet monster who hates when people splash water on the
floor and when there is tissue paper on the floor. If we don’t keep the
floor clean, <em>we</em> will be used to clean the floor and if we don’t
throw the tissue paper in the bin the monster will use <em>us</em> to throw
rubbish into our mouth!</p>
<p>Next up we have the toilet bowl monster. The toilet bowl monster does
not like it when people do not flush the toilet bowl. If we don’t flush
the toilet, the flush monster will flush us down the toilet. Last but not
least, we have the toilet bowl monster’s cousin, the toilet seat monster!
The toilet seat monster does not like it when the toilet seats are dirty.
If we don’t keep the toilet seat clean, <em>we</em> will be used to clean
the toilet seat.</p>
