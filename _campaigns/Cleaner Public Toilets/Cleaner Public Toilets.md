<p>Imagine stepping into a clean public toilet and knowing exactly what winning
feels like! Our slogan for this year’s campaign, <strong><em>“Everyone wins when our toilets are clean!”</em></strong>,
champions the idea that maintaining clean toilets is a team effort where
everyone comes out a winner. When we all play our part, every toilet visit
becomes a victory for everyone!</p>
<p>Join our winning streak by keeping public toilets clean and pleasant.
We're not just scoring points for good hygiene; we're contributing to better
public health and improving everyone's well-being.</p>
<p>You can be a champion of cleanliness by doing these 4 winning actions
(<strong>Clean, Flush, Dry and Bin</strong>) each time you use the toilet:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Keep the toilet seats <strong>CLEAN</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>FLUSH</strong> toilet fully</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep the floor <strong>DRY</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>BIN</strong> litter properly&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
