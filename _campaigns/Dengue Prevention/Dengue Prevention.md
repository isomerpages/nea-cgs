<h3>This is No Small Matter. Dengue Prevention is in Your Hands.</h3>
<p>Remember "little mosquitoes can be lethal"? It is easy to underestimate
something small like the <em>Aedes</em> mosquito, but the severe consequences
it can bring to our health are <strong>no small matter</strong>.</p>
<p>This year's tagline, "This is No Small Matter," reinforces this crucial
point. It reminds us that both the seemingly insignificant mosquito and
the serious disease it carries demand our full attention and proactive
action.</p>
<p><strong>Why is Dengue Prevention <em>No Small Matter</em>?</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Dengue affects all of us.</strong> Thinking "it won't happen to
me" is a risk we cannot afford. This disease can impact your family, your
neighbours, and the entire community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The risk is real and present.</strong> With warm weather and high
Aedes mosquito population, the threat of dengue is constant. Ignoring potential
breeding spots or skipping preventive measures can have real consequences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Severe dengue can be fatal.</strong> It can lead to serious complications,
hospitalisation, and even be life-threatening. Visit the <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/seeking-healthcare/overview-of-diseases/communicable-diseases/dengue" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Ministry of Healthâ€™s website</a> for
information on symptoms, potential complications, and treatment of dengue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dengue can spread from person to mosquito to person.</strong> A
female mosquito becomes infected after taking the blood of a person infected
with the virus. After about one week, the mosquito can transmit the virus
while biting a healthy person.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Your Actions Can Have a Lethal Impact on Mosquitoes</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Remove stagnant water in your home.</strong> Mosquitoes can breed
in stagnant water the size of a 20-cent coin. Prevent mosquito breeding
and safeguard your home with B-L-O-C-K.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Break dengue transmission.</strong> Check if you live in a <a href="https://www.nea.gov.sg/dengue-zika/dengue/dengue-clusters" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">dengue cluster area</a> or
in an <a href="https://www.nea.gov.sg/dengue-zika/Aedes" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">area with more </a><em><a href="https://www.nea.gov.sg/dengue-zika/Aedes" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Aedes</a></em>
<a href="https://www.nea.gov.sg/dengue-zika/Aedes" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">mosquitoes</a>, as you will have a higher risk of being bitten and infected
with the dengue virus. Protect yourself and your family with S-A-W.</p>

<li>
<p>Download the myENV app. Get <a href="https://www.nea.gov.sg/docs/default-source/default-document-library/aedes-myenv-app-v34e8eea8675eb456a822b53658431649b.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">notifications on dengue clusters and areas with higher Aedes aegypti mosquito population</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you notice potential mosquito breeding habitats in your community,
report them on the <a href="https://www.nea.gov.sg/corporate-functions/feedback" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">NEA website</a>,
<a href="https://www.nea.gov.sg/myenv" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">myENV app</a>or <a href="https://www.oneservice.gov.sg/download-the-oneservice-app" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">OneService app</a>.
Every report helps us to keep our community safe from dengue.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Our collective effort makes a big difference.</strong> Every action,
no matter how small it seems, contributes to reducing the risk and impact
of dengue in Singapore.</p>
