<p><strong>“Dengue covered my whole body in rashes, and my skin was sore to the touch!"</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>On top of rashes, I also had chronic headaches and high fever, which peaked
at 42 degrees Celsius. The worst part was feeling so sick yet needing to
drag myself to the polyclinic to get my blood tests done daily for a week,
and there being not much medication to aid my symptoms other than pain
killers.</p>
<p>All I could do was lie in bed and hope it would get over soon. It was
literally hell for that whole week. I could not wait for the entire ordeal
to be over.”</p>
