<p><strong>The Keep Singapore Clean Movement</strong>
</p>
<p>The Keep Singapore Clean Movement (KSCM) is a national call for Singapore
to move from being a ‘cleaned city’ to a ‘truly clean city’. The Movement
is led by the Public Hygiene Council (PHC), Singapore Kindness Movement
(SKM), and is supported by the National Environment Agency (NEA).</p>
<p>To drive awareness of the Keep Singapore Clean Movement and bring the
cleanliness challenge to the forefront of the public's consciousness, a
series of related activities that incorporate positive messages on social
graciousness and consideration for others are held regularly.</p>
