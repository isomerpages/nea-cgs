<p>NUS Cities, in collaboration with the National Environment Agency and
Public Hygiene Council, unveiled a captivating booklet titled “The Green
Guardians of Singapore” in support of the Year of Public Hygiene in August
2024.</p>
<p>“The Green Guardians of Singapore” immerses readers in the fictional tale
of Captain Green and the Keep Singapore Clean Supermons as they shield
Singapore from an environmental crisis provoked by alien invaders. These
invaders wield hypnotic powers to transform citizens into careless litterbugs,
resulting in widespread pollution, illness, and economic stagnation. The
cheerful and eco-conscious frog, Captain Green, joins forces with the Supermons
- Trashemon, Toilemon, and Trayremon - to reclaim the city's cleanliness
and green spaces.</p>
<p>Through compelling storytelling and informative content, the booklet aims
to ignite a sense of responsibility in its readers, inspiring them to contribute
to a cleaner, greener, and more resilient Singapore.</p>
<p>Here’s the online version of <a href="https://heyzine.com/flip-book/SGGreenGuardians" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">"The Green Guardians of Singapore"</a>.
