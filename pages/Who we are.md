<h2>CLEAN AND GREEN SINGAPORE VISION</h2>
<p><span style="color: green;"><strong>Clean and Green Singapore (CGS)</strong></span> aims to inspire Singaporeans to care for and protect our environment by adopting a clean, green and sustainable lifestyle. Each of us can shape our neighbourhoods and common spaces through our green practices, championing a sustainable way of life, and by being a more gracious society. Together, we can make Singapore A Liveable and Endearing Home, and A Vibrant and Sustainable City.</p>
<p><strong>A Liveable and Endearing Home</strong> - Safeguarding green and blue spaces; embracing smart technology and eco-friendly features in our towns and homes; and enjoying a seamless transportation network in Singapore, which reinforce green living.</p>
<p><strong>A Vibrant and Sustainable City</strong> â€“ The Government, the community and businesses coming together to develop infrastructure, programmes and jobs that support the move towards a Zero Waste Nation and a leading green economy.</p>
