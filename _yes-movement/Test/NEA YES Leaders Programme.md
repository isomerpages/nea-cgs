<p>A key initiative under the Youth for Environmental Sustainability (YES)
movement, the NEA YES Leaders programme (YES LP) aims to develop passionate
and active youth leaders in the environmental sphere. The programme provides
learning opportunities for the leaders to build up their environmental
knowledge and skillsets; and supports them in gaining practical experience
putting these to work through the implementation of sustainability projects
in their school campuses or the community.</p>
<p>YES LP also provides platforms for youth leaders to network with their
peers as well as be exposed to international organisations involved in
environmental work. Participants who successfully complete the YES LP will
join NEAâ€™s YES Network, comprising youth leaders from our various youth
engagement programmes.</p>
