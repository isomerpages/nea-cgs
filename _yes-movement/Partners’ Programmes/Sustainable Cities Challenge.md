<p><strong><em>Sustainable Cities Challenge</em></strong>
</p>
<p>PacificLight Power Pte Ltd has launched the inaugural Sustainable Cities
Challenge. The competition is open to all tertiary students from junior
colleges, polytechnics, Institutes of Education (ITE) and equivalent institutions
in Singapore. Participating students will have an opportunity to reimagine
sustainability, by working on a real-world case study and proposing green
improvements. Through the competition, they will gain a deeper understanding
of the built environment, and the impact that design and technology have
on sustainability.</p>
