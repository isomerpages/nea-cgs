<p><strong><em>Zero Waste Testbed Initiative @ South West - Upcycling Edition</em></strong>
</p>
<p>With growing interest from youths to be involved in tackling sustainability
challenges, the Zero Waste Testbed Initiative @ South West was launched
by the National University of Singapore (NUS), South West Community Development
Council (South West CDC) and SembWaste earlier this year to provide a funding
and industry mentorship platform for NUS students and young alumni* to
create change by realising their ideas in actual practices using the NUS
campus as a Living Lab.</p>
<p>NUS, South West CDC, SembWaste and L’Oréal Group Singapore are now partnering
to introduce an Upcycling Edition, which will look at ideas that can continually
drive the Circular Economy. L’Oréal Group will engage consumers in Singapore
to bring their empty beauty containers (e.g. glass) from all brands, to
dedicated collection points. Participating NUS students and young alumni
can then create innovative solutions to turn the empty containers into
new products, that are meaningful or have a community social element to
it.
<br>
<br>*The initiative is also open to other youths if they form a team involving
at least 1 NUS student or 1 young NUS alumni (within 1 year of graduation).</p>
