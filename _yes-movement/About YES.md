<p>The Youth for Environmental Sustainability (YES) Movement traces its roots
to the Youth for the Environment Day (YED), an annual observation held
since 2011.</p>
<p>In 2021, the National Environment Agency (NEA) evolved YED from a single-day
event into the year-long YES Movement. This better supports youths’ interest
in environmental sustainability, by providing a more sustained platform
to engage them and help develop their environmental leadership capabilities.
The YES Movement also supports the Singapore Green Plan 2030’s Sustainable
Living pillar, by encouraging active green citizenry by youths.</p>
<p>The YES Movement has 3 key goals:</p>

<p>NEA welcomes the support of partners and stakeholders. Together, we can
provide opportunities for our youths to be involved in meaningful activities,
and contribute to Singapore’s long-term sustainability. Partners who have
relevant programmes, challenges and volunteering opportunities can publicise
their activities on our YES microsite, providing a convenient one-stop
portal for our youths.</p>
