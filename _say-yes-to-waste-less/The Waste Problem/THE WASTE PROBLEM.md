<h2>Reducing Food Wastage</h2>
<p>Food is a labour of love. And it is shown by the farmers who work tirelessly,
the hawkers who cook from dawn to dusk, our loved ones who thoughtfully
prepare our meals, and the organisations who try to ensure everyone has
food to eat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, food isn’t always appreciated and valued.&nbsp;</p>

we can finish.</p>
