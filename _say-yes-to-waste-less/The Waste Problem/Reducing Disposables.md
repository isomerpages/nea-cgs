<h3>REDUCING DISPOSABLES</h3>
<p>Every year, we discard around 200,000 million kg of disposables. At the
current rate of waste disposal, our only landfill, Semakau Landfill, will
be fully filled by 2035. We can’t go on like this.</p>
<p>Our national goal is to reduce the amount of waste sent to Semakau Landfill
by 30 per cent per capita per day by 2030. Under the <a href="https://www.greenplan.gov.sg/targets" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Singapore Green Plan 2030 (SGP)</a>,
we are frontloading this to achieve a 20 per cent reduction in waste-to-landfill
per capita per day by 2026.</p>
<p>Let’s choose to use clean reusable carrier bags, containers and bottles,
and keep Singapore green for future generations.</p>
