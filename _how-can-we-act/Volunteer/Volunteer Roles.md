<h3>Community Auditor</h3>
<p>Launched in September 2020, the Community Auditor Programme aims to enhance
the cleanliness of private residential estates through community engagement
and participation. The programme recruits residents of private estates
to serve as Community Auditors to conduct audits on the performance of
the Integrated Public Cleaning Service Providers.</p>
<p>Community Auditors will receive training on topics such as cleaning for
public health, operations of public cleaning services, economics of providing
such services in a cost-effective manner and principles of auditing the
cleaning performance of service providers. Community Auditors can submit
their findings and observations online for NEA to conduct follow-ups with
the service providers.</p>
<p><strong>To participate in the Community Auditor programme, please register your interest at <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.go.gov.sg/regint4ca</a>.</strong>

<h3>Community Volunteer</h3>
<p>The Community Volunteer (CV) Programme was launched in 2013 to encourage
greater community ownership, and to leverage social pressure for greater
deterrence against litterbugs. The programme was previously only open to
members of Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and public officers.</p>
<p>As members of the public and CVs have expressed interest in playing a
more active role in keeping our environment clean, NEA now allows individuals
to join the CV programme without having to be affiliated with any recognised
environmental group. These CVs will be empowered to engage offenders for
a wider range of offences which include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Littering in public places;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pet defecation in public places;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Smoking in prohibited places;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spitting in public places;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Urinating in public places; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leaving the engine of a stationary vehicle running</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Should CVs observe any smoky vehicle on the road, they could take down
details of the vehicle, date, time of offence and submit to NEA for follow-up
action. CVs can choose to focus on educating offenders on taking ownership
of the environment, supporting research in specialised areas of work, or
participating in public outreach and educational activities.</p>
<p>All CVs are required to adopt a ‘Bright Spot’ or any preferred area and
keep it clean. Monthly activities will be carried out at the adopted areas
by CVs.</p>
<p>To help CVs perform this role effectively, NEA will provide comprehensive
training and assessment before they are issued with an authority card (i.e.
to facilitate requests for particulars) against any non-compliant environmental
offender. Offenders’ particulars will be submitted to NEA for follow-up
action.</p>
<p>Criteria for community volunteers:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Aged 18 to 80 years old*</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Singapore citizen or Permanent Resident</p>
</li>
