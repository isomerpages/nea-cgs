<h3>ECO PADDLE WITH OLA</h3>
<p>📆 18 May to 7 Dec 2025, 10:00 AM - 1:00 PM
<br>📍 Ola Beach Club, Sentosa</p>
<p>Ready to make a splash for the environment? Join us at Ola Beach Club
for a kayaking clean-up adventure like no other! Paddle out in double kayaks
to scoop up marine litter and learn first-hand how it impacts our ocean
ecosystem and marine life.</p>
<p>But that’s not all - unleash your creativity in our upcycling workshop,
where you'll turn ocean trash into unique treasures to take home. It's
fun, it's eco-friendly, and it’s a chance to be part of something bigger!</p>
<p>Registration opens online on 12 May 2025 at 10 AM. Don't miss out - let's
make waves together for a cleaner, greener ocean!</p>
