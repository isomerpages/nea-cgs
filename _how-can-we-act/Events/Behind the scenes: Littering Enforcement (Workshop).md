<h3>BEHIND-THE-SCENES OF LITTERING ENFORCEMENT WORKSHOP</h3>
<p>📆 7 Jun to 28 Jun 2025, 03:00 PM - 04:30 PM
<br>📍 Environment Building
<br>Join us for a "litter-ally" awesome workshop with our NEA enforcement
officers, who help keep our environment clean, for everyone to enjoy!</p>
<p>In this hands-on session, you’ll get the inside scoop on how these everyday
heroes tackle antisocial behaviour, one litterbug at a time. It’s not just
a workshop - it’s an opportunity to see what it takes to be a frontline
officer responsible for making sure everyone does their part to make Singapore’s
spaces shine.</p>
<p>Registration opens online on 12 May 2025 at 10 AM. Don’t miss your chance
- it’s going to be a clean sweep!</p>
